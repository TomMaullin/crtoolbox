    "Welcome to the Confidence Regions Workshop at OHBM 2023! This workshop will introduce you to the concept of Confidence Regions (CRs) and how they can be used to make inferences about brain activity. The session shall cover the generation of CRs for excursion sets derived from %BOLD maps, standardized (Cohen’s D) effect size images, and conjunctions (overlaps) for both, and demonstrate CRs using a range of examples. By the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What CRs are, both conceptually and mathematically.\n",
    "- When you may want to use CRs, and why.\n",
    "- The factors that influence the size and shape of CRs.\n",
    "- Common pitfalls of CR interepretation.\n",
    "- What software is available to generate CRs, and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will discuss CRs in the context of the recent debate about the use of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) in neuroimaging, and explain how CRs can be used to complement NHST. We shall also consider extensions of the CR method to other types of data, such as effect size images and conjunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions during this session, please feel free to ask me in person at any time, or reach out via email at [TomMaullin@gmail.com](mailto:TomMaullin@gmail.com). An anonymous feedback for is also available here MARKER."

    "Conceptually, CRs are similar to confidence intervals but, instead of upper and lower bounds for a scalar parameter, they provide estimated inner and outer sets, $\\hat{A}_c^{+}$ and $\\hat{A}_c^{-}$, to bound an excursion set $A_c$. When we see wide confidence intervals for a scalar parameter estimate, this suggests that the procedure which produced the estimate is not very reliable.\n",
